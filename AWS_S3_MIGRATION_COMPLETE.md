# AWS S3 Migration Complete ✅

## Summary

The vision feature backend has been successfully migrated from Supabase Storage to **AWS S3** for screenshot storage.

---

## What Changed

### ✅ Added Components

1. **S3 Service Module** (`app/services/s3_service.py`)
   - Upload screenshots to S3
   - Download screenshots from S3
   - Delete screenshots
   - Generate presigned URLs (temporary access)
   - Bulk delete operations
   - Health check for S3 connectivity

2. **Updated Vision Router** (`app/routers/vision.py`)
   - New endpoint: `POST /api/vision/screenshots/upload/{user_id}`
   - New endpoint: `GET /api/vision/screenshots/presigned-url`
   - New endpoint: `DELETE /api/vision/screenshots/{storage_path}`
   - Updated health endpoint to show S3 status

3. **Updated Dependencies** (`requirements.txt`)
   - Added `boto3>=1.34.0` for AWS SDK
   - Added `python-socketio>=5.11.0`

4. **Environment Configuration** (`.env.example`)
   - AWS credentials
   - S3 bucket configuration
   - Region settings

## S3 Storage Structure

Screenshots are stored in a hierarchical structure:

```
squire-screenshots/
  ├── {user_id}/
  │   ├── 2025/
  │   │   ├── 10/
  │   │   │   ├── {screenshot_id}.png
  │   │   │   ├── {screenshot_id}.png
  │   │   │   └── ...
  │   │   ├── 11/
  │   │   │   └── ...
```

**Example path:**
```
550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/2025/10/abc123-def456.png
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy to implement retention policies (delete by year/month)
- Efficient browsing in AWS console
- Supports multi-user isolation

## API Endpoints

### Screenshot Management

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/vision/screenshots/upload/{user_id}` | POST | Upload screenshot to S3 |
| `/api/vision/screenshots/presigned-url` | GET | Generate temporary access URL |
| `/api/vision/screenshots/{storage_path}` | DELETE | Delete screenshot from S3 |
| `/api/vision/health` | GET | Check S3 connection status |

### Example Usage

**Upload Screenshot:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/vision/screenshots/upload/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 \
  -F "file=@screenshot.png"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "screenshot_id": "abc-123-def-456",
  "url": "https://squire-screenshots.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/.../abc-123.png",
  "storage_path": "550e8400-.../2025/10/abc-123.png",
  "size_bytes": 12345
}
```

**Generate Presigned URL:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/vision/screenshots/presigned-url?storage_path=550e8400-.../2025/10/abc-123.png&expiration=3600"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "url": "https://squire-screenshots.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/...?X-Amz-Expires=3600...",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

---

## Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Add to `squire-backend/.env`:

```bash
# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA...your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_S3_BUCKET=squire-screenshots
```

### IAM Permissions Required

The AWS user needs these S3 permissions:
- `s3:PutObject` - Upload screenshots
- `s3:GetObject` - Download screenshots
- `s3:DeleteObject` - Delete screenshots
- `s3:ListBucket` - List bucket contents

---

## Cost Estimates

### AWS S3 Storage Costs

**Standard Storage:**
- First 50 TB: $0.023 per GB/month
- Screenshot size: ~100-500 KB each
- 1000 screenshots ≈ 100-500 MB ≈ **$0.002-0.01/month**

**Requests:**
- PUT requests: $0.005 per 1000 requests
- GET requests: $0.0004 per 1000 requests
- 1000 uploads + 1000 downloads ≈ **$0.0054**

**Data Transfer:**
- Data out to internet: $0.09/GB (first 10 TB)
- If downloading 1 GB of screenshots: **$0.09**

**Total estimated cost:**
- Storage + requests: **~$0.01-0.02/month** for typical usage
- Very affordable, especially with AWS credits!

## Setup Steps (Quick Reference)

1. **Create S3 bucket** in AWS Console
2. **Create IAM user** with S3 permissions
3. **Add credentials** to `.env` file
4. **Install dependencies**: `pip install boto3`
5. **Start backend**: `python main.py`
6. **Test health check**: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/vision/health`

---

## Testing Checklist

Use the comprehensive testing guide: `PHASE1_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

Quick verification:

```bash
# 1. Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/api/vision/health
# Should show: "s3_status": "connected"

# 2. Upload test
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/vision/screenshots/upload/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 \
  -F "file=@test.png"
# Should return success with S3 URL

# 3. Check S3
# Go to AWS S3 Console and verify file appears in bucket
```

---

## Advantages of S3 over Supabase Storage

1. **Cost**: You have AWS credits!
2. **Scalability**: Unlimited storage, auto-scales
3. **Performance**: Edge locations, low latency
4. **Reliability**: 99.999999999% durability (11 nines)
5. **Features**: Lifecycle policies, versioning, encryption
6. **Integration**: Works well with other AWS services

## Troubleshooting

### S3 connection fails

**Check:**
1. AWS credentials are correct in `.env`
2. Bucket name matches exactly
3. IAM user has S3 permissions
4. Bucket exists in specified region

**Test AWS CLI:**
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://squire-screenshots
```

### Upload fails with 403 error

**Solution:**
- IAM user needs `PutObject` permission
- Check bucket policy doesn't block uploads

### Presigned URL doesn't work

**Solution:**
- Verify storage_path is correct
- URL should be used within expiration time
- Check file exists in S3
